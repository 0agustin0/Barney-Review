    Growing up my childhood revolved around watching Barney before school as I ate cookie crisp cereal. 
    The most memorable moment in Barney is its theme song when starting an episode.
    The show barney & Friends is one of my elite childhood experiences when reflecting back on my youth.
    <br> Now I'm going to share a few things I enjoyed from the show.
